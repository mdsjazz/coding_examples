# coding_examples
A simple repository containing some examples of my coding. This is not meant to be impressive, rather just show that I know how to code and organize my work.


Some preface:

distributions_and_estimation.py is a simple module I use in my work at my company. I chose to include it because it contains minimal information about what we do, as I am supposed keep details a secret.

word2vec.py is mostly not my code, rather a simple stencil given by Stanford's CS department for their introduction to NLP classes. I liked my coding on this assignment because I suppose I was meticulous about optimizing my data manipulation, so I vectorized every computation using simple vector calculus/matrix relations and increased the speed of computation tenfold compared to many other submissions I saw littered around Github. In other parts of the assignment, I replaced simple SGD with Adam optimization and other metaheuristics, so my word2vec distributions turned out pretty well in less time, especially on my dinosaur Macbook from 2013.
